T-Claw's mission is to support regularly occurring traditional style old 
time square dances in the southeast region and the country abroad.

T calls for beginners and well seasoned dancers. T-Claw Calling strives 
to keep the moves accessible for a mixed crowd, and entertains with 
ferocious fervor. Claw focuses on traditional mountain styles but has 
many other tricks to employ.
