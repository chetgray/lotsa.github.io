Louisville Old Time Squares Association (LOTSA) is a group of people 
dedicated to building community using traditional-style square dance. We 
run a monthly series of dances, our Third Thursday Hoedown in 
Germantown, at the AmVets Post #9 in Louisville's Schnitzelburg 
neighborhood, and help set up and promote other traditional-style square 
dances and old-time music events around town. We also coordinate with 
traditional music & dance groups in surrounding cities, helping to pass 
along bands and callers between gigs.

Check us out [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOTSA/) and [on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/louisvillesquares).
