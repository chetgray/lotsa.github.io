We had about a half dozen LOTSA folks head to idyllic Helvetia, West Virginia a couple weeks ago for Dare to be 
Square: three days and two nights of learning, jamming, dancing, and having an all-'round grand time. More, and 
nearer, Dare to be Square weekends are on the horizon, and they are not to be missed. Save the date for [Dare to be 
Square Nashville, Oct 1–4][DTBS Nashville FB].

Plenty of dancing coming up in the near future, folks:

JamVets are our own Louisville-based band of Old Time musicians, who call the Amvets post home every Thursday night.
When they start playing in the game room, its hard not to start tapping your foot to their tunes.
Led by Harry Bickel on banjo, there'll be several of these musicians adding their unique style to each dance.

Chet Gray and Alex Udis of LOTSA will anchor a set of open calling.
Got that patter down? Always wanted to get on that stage and call a dance? Well, this is a great opportunity and audience for that. We love local talent and would love to have you call a dance.
Sign up on [the Facebook event][Hoedown FB] or at the dance, or just snatch that mic from us (well, maybe not that...)

All dances TAUGHT.
No experience necessary.
No one is required to dance.
It is a SOCIAL event.
Predominantly simple and traditional southern figures.
No dress code, No partner needed.
Anyone can dance with ANYONE regardless of gender.

Wanna JAM? Harry Bickel's old time music jam is in the bar, beginning at 7pm.
Bring your instrument to participate in the all level jam!
No cover if you're just going to jam, but please enter through Danny Mac's main door.

See [the Facebook event][Hoedown FB] or [the Meetup event][Hoedown MU] for more details,
or if you'd like to volunteer to help set up, work the door, or clean up (and get into the dance for free!)

and do other similar projects. They'll also spend about two hours during the week doing odd jobs for the facility -- 
e.g., picking up sticks and trash, painting a wall. Come dance to the calling of Seth Tepfer, Diane Silver, Lauren 
Peckman, and others and the music of the Coffee Zombies! Questions? Email kbp@cumberlanddanceweek.org
