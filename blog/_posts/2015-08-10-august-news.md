Hello, all,

First, let us voice an overwhelming "THANK YOU!" to everybody who came 
out to LOTSA's three year anniversary dance last month. We make these 
dances happen because you all keep coming to 'em, and it's ya'll who 
make them *happening*! LOTSA's celebration certainly was happening.

Special thanks to
[Please & Thank You](http://www.pleaseandthankyoulouisville.com/)
and Jane Mattingly for helping us with that awesome birthday cake, and 
to T-Claw for not only calling but also baking the squared pie.

Plenty of dancing this month, and some exciting announcements for the 
fall. Read on for details.

Here's to three years of hoedowns, and many more years to come. See 
y'all on the dance floor!

<h2>[Northside Square Dance][], Peter Rogers calling</h2>
<h3>Cincinnati, OH</h3>
</hgroup>

[Northside Squares][Northside Square Dance] love Peter Rogers! It's his 
3rd visit from Frankfort KY to call really fun old-time circles and 
squares. He's smooth, he's confident, and he makes it soooooooo easy for 
beginners and veteran dancers alike. Bring your whoops and hollers. If 
it's the 2nd Tuesday, it's time for the Northside Tavern back room 
square dance, donation $5 per dancer. Don't forget to buy beers from 
back room barkeep Amanda Daulton; that keeps us in our wonderful dance 
space. Music by the Northside Volunteers.

See [the Facebook event][Cincinnati FB] for more details.

<h3>Sunday, August 16th</h3>
<h2>Irish set dancing</h2>
<h3>Molly Malone's on Baxter Ave</h3>
</hgroup>

[Deborah Denenfeld](http://www.deborahdenenfeld.com/) will be leading 
dancers in Irish sets to live music from 5pm to 8pm at Molly Malone's 
Irish Pub
([933 Baxter Ave](http://maps.google.com/?q=933+Baxter+Ave,+Louisville,+KY)).
This is *not* the high kicking, on their toes, Irish *step* dance of 
Riverdance. *Set* dancing is social dancing, traditional to many parlors 
and pubs in communities throughout Ireland, done in square formation to 
jigs, reels and hornpipes. Deborah's been fortunate to learn these 
dances in Ireland and now leads Irish sets in Louisville. It's easy, 
requires no prior knowledge, and you don't need to bring a partner. 
Dancing is interspersed by socializing over food and beverages. Big fun! 
Live music! All moves taught!

If you can, please RSVP to [Deborah: 502-889-6584](tel:5028896584)
