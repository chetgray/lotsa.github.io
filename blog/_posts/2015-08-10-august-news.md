Hello, all,

First, let us voice an overwhelming "THANK YOU!" to everybody who came 
out to LOTSA's three year anniversary dance last month. We make these 
dances happen because you all keep coming to 'em, and it's ya'll who 
make them *happening*! LOTSA's celebration certainly was happening.

Special thanks to
[Please & Thank You](http://www.pleaseandthankyoulouisville.com/)
and Jane Mattingly for helping us with that awesome birthday cake, and 
to T-Claw for not only calling but also baking the squared pie.

Plenty of dancing this month, and some exciting announcements for the 
fall.

In October, [Dare to be Square](#dtbs-nashville), a weekend of square 
dance and music, will be coming to Nashville. They've been held all 
around the country, but this is the closest we've had one to Louisville. 
This is not something to miss, folks. Caller, dancer, musician workshops 
during the day, hot dancing to hot tunes at night. Volunteer and 
sponsorships are being sought; see [the details below](#dtbs-nashville) 
to get in touch.

In [November, our regular 
Hoedown](http://www.meetup.com/louisvillesquaresandcontras/events/223428305/) 
falls adjacent to [Louisville Country Dancers][]' annual [Fleur de Lis 
Fling contra dance weekend](#fdlf), and we are fortunate enough to share 
some amazing talent with them: band Turnip the Beet and caller Will 
Mentor. If you'd like to get in more dancing to them, [register for 
Fleur de Lis Fling][FDLF WWW], and **register soon**. Registration has 
been open only one week, and it is already more than 25% sold out. [More 
information can be found below](#fdlf).

Here's to three years of hoedowns, and many more years to come. See 
y'all on the dance floor!

<h2>[Northside Square Dance][], Peter Rogers calling</h2>
<h3>Cincinnati, OH</h3>
</hgroup>

[Northside Squares][Northside Square Dance] love Peter Rogers! It's his 
3rd visit from Frankfort KY to call really fun old-time circles and 
squares. He's smooth, he's confident, and he makes it soooooooo easy for 
beginners and veteran dancers alike. Bring your whoops and hollers. If 
it's the 2nd Tuesday, it's time for the Northside Tavern back room 
square dance, donation $5 per dancer. Don't forget to buy beers from 
back room barkeep Amanda Daulton; that keeps us in our wonderful dance 
space. Music by the Northside Volunteers.

See [the Facebook event][Cincinnati FB] for more details.

<h3>Sunday, August 16th</h3>
<h2>Irish set dancing</h2>
<h3>Molly Malone's on Baxter Ave</h3>
</hgroup>

[Deborah Denenfeld](http://www.deborahdenenfeld.com/) will be leading 
dancers in Irish sets to live music from 5pm to 8pm at Molly Malone's 
Irish Pub
([933 Baxter Ave](http://maps.google.com/?q=933+Baxter+Ave,+Louisville,+KY)).
This is *not* the high kicking, on their toes, Irish *step* dance of 
Riverdance. *Set* dancing is social dancing, traditional to many parlors 
and pubs in communities throughout Ireland, done in square formation to 
jigs, reels and hornpipes. Deborah's been fortunate to learn these 
dances in Ireland and now leads Irish sets in Louisville. It's easy, 
requires no prior knowledge, and you don't need to bring a partner. 
Dancing is interspersed by socializing over food and beverages. Big fun! 
Live music! All moves taught!

If you can, please RSVP to [Deborah: 502-889-6584](tel:5028896584)

**Registration opened August 1st.** After one week, Fleur de Lis Fling 
is more than **25% sold out** of the new larger hall! Dancers registered 
from 14 states so far from NM to NY and MN to NC.

LCD has moved to a new, larger hall and will be able to accommodate 40 
more dancers for the weekend. **Get your registration in early as it 
have SOLD OUT four years in a row.**

Registration forms are available on the [Fleur de Lis Fling 
website][FDLF WWW].

Fleur de Lis Fling is a weekend of contra (and square) dancing sponsored 
by the [Louisville Country Dancers][] each November. There will be 
workshops throughout the day on Saturday and one led by Will Mentor on 
Sunday for callers.

The Louisville Country Dancers are pleased to welcome [The 
Stringrays](http://stringraysmusic.com/) to Fleur de Lis Fling 2015! 
Dancers should prepare to be drawn into a whirlwind of dance music that 
will lift their feet and hearts while shaking their hips and elbows. 
Stringrays' music encapsulates both the improvisational and traditional 
sides of New England fiddle music. Hot licks are traded back and forth, 
followed by uplifting tunes played with such freshness that one wouldn't 
know they are 100 years old.

Coming to Louisville straight from Nashville, TN, the down-home duo of 
[Turnip the Beet](http://turnipthebeetmusic.com/) combines both European 
and American folk influences to produce an organic, musical harvest of 
toe-tapping tunes. They are no stranger to the contra community, as the 
band has provided the soundtrack to dozens of contra and square dances 
in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, and Tennessee 
since 2013.

See [the Fleur de Lis Fling website][FDLF WWW], [the Facebook 
event][FDLF FB], or [the Meetup event][FDLF MU] for more details.
